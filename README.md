## Auto-generated-api
Priya Sudhir Suvarna (801366527)

This code is generated using Loopback 4. Loopback 4 is an open source framework based on NodeJS and Express to rapidly create APIs and microservices. As an exercise, I created a controller 'auto-generated-api' using 'lb4 controller' command (which automatically created the controller in 'src/controllers' directory) and added 2 endpoints as follows -

1. /hello - A GET method that returns a string

2. /profile - A GET method that returns a string with my introduction

# Below README is auto generated by Loopback 4 -

This application is generated using [LoopBack 4 CLI](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Command-line-interface.html) with the
[initial project layout](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Loopback-application-layout.html).
